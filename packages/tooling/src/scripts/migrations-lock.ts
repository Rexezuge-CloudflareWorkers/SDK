/**
 * Record newly-added migration files in `migrations/migrations.lock.json`.
 *
 * Provenance: Edge-Sonic's `scripts/migrations/verify-migrations.ts --write`,
 * which is the only repo that splits the two operations into two commands. The
 * other repos have one script with a flag; the split is kept here because the two
 * calls have different audiences and different blast radii — `verify-migrations`
 * runs in CI and changes nothing, while this one is an operator action that writes
 * a file into version control.
 *
 * The rules live once, in `verify-migrations.ts`, so the two entrypoints cannot
 * disagree. `--write` is add-only: it records unlocked files, refreshes the
 * baseline's own entry, and drops entries the baseline absorbed. It never touches
 * another existing entry, so an incremental migration that has drifted still
 * fails afterwards — re-baselining one means deleting its entry by hand, which
 * shows up in the diff.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `--force`, because a write that could bless a drift
 * without reading the drift is the operator blessing their own edit, and they are
 * by definition the one making it.
 *
 * Usage, from the repo root:
 *
 * ```bash
 * pnpm exec tsx scripts/migrations-lock.ts                   # ./migrations
 * pnpm exec tsx scripts/migrations-lock.ts path/to/migrations
 * ```
