/**
 * Verify the migration set is complete, ordered, and locked; write the lock.
 *
 * Provenance: Edge-Sonic's `scripts/migrations/{verify-migrations,lock-check}.ts`
 * (the rule module plus its entrypoint) and AWS's `verify-migrations.ts`,
 * converged. Every copy checks the same properties of a `migrations/` directory;
 * they differ in lock-file naming, in whether the lock is enforced on CI, and in
 * how much of D1's ordering semantics they encode.
 *
 * ### Why a checksum lock at all
 *
 * D1 records *which* migrations it has applied — the filename and a timestamp —
 * but not *what the file contained* when it applied them. So editing a migration
 * that has already run is not caught by anything: the deploy still succeeds, the
 * local database built from the baseline plus the edited file picks up the new
 * statements, and production keeps the schema it had. The two databases then
 * differ silently and permanently, and the next migration that assumes the newer
 * shape fails only in production. A committed digest per file turns that into a
 * CI failure.
 *
 * ### What the checks are, and where each comes from
 *
 * - **`NNNN_snake_case.sql`** (AWS) — the numbering *is* the ordering: D1 sorts by
 *   filename, so a file that sorts *after* the ones already applied is the only
 *   kind that can be introduced safely.
 * - **Contiguous prefixes** (AWS) — a hole means one database applied 0001 and
 *   0003 while another applied only 0001, and nothing downstream can tell which.
 *   Checked **only when no squash baseline exists**: a squash legitimately
 *   absorbs its predecessors, so numbering restarts wherever it starts, and a
 *   contiguity rule that fires on a squash is a rule that blocks the squash.
 * - **One entry per file** (all) — a file with no recorded digest is one nothing
 *   can say anything about.
 * - **Digest unchanged** (all) — the edited-after-locking failure.
 * - **No orphan entries** (Edge-Sonic) — a locked file that is gone has been
 *   applied to a live database and is no longer reproducible from this repo.
 * - **Strictly increasing prefixes** (Edge-Sonic's `out-of-order`) — a file
 *   sorting *before* the newest locked one can never reach a database that has
 *   applied that newest one, so its statements would only run on a fresh build.
 * - **No duplicate prefixes** (Edge-Sonic) — two files numbered `0033_` are not a
 *   style problem: D1 orders them by the rest of the filename, so which one lands
 *   on a given database depends on a lexicographic tiebreak nobody intended.
 *
 * ### The squash baseline
 *
 * `0008_squash.sql` holds the combined schema of every migration before it, and
 * those files are deleted when it is created. A later squash repeats that. So a
 * squash legitimately (a) rewrites one file and (b) removes files the lock still
 * lists, and neither may be reported as drift. The baseline is the
 * highest-numbered `NNNN_squash.sql` **on disk**, never the value the lock claims
 * — deriving it means a stale or forged `baseline` cannot widen the exempt set.
 *
 * ### The one write path
 *
 * `--write` is add-only where it counts: it records unlocked files, refreshes the
 * baseline's own entry, and drops entries the baseline absorbed. Every other
 * entry is left exactly as it is, so an incremental `edited` finding **survives a
 * `--write`** — re-baselining one means deleting its entry by hand, which shows
 * up in the diff. There is deliberately no `--force`, because a write that could
 * bless a drift would be the operator blessing their own edit.
